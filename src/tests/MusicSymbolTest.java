/**
 * This is the test suite for equals(), toString(), and hashCode() for the
 * classes in the MusicSymbol interface. The addNote(main) method is tested in
 * MusicPlayerTest.java as its main role is to modify the main.
 * 
 * Moreover, we test the particular methods of the classes that implement the
 * interface: Pitch: multiplyLength(), getLength(), Chord: multiplyLength().
 * 
 * Testing strategy: test each method and make sure it is true to its spec for
 * every valid type of input. equals() must return true on equal objects, and
 * false on unequal objects. toString() must provide the appropriate string
 * representation of the object. hashCode() must return a hashcode that is the
 * same for equal objects.
 * 
 * For Pitch, make sure everything works correctly regardless of how many
 * modifiers there are (, ,, ^ ^^ _ __ and duration), and same for Rest (it only
 * has duration). For Chord, partition on the number of MusicSymbols it has.
 * Also, make sure duration shows up correctly (ie. 1/1 should be nothing, 1/2
 * should be /2)
