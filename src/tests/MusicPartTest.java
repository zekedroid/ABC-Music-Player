/**
 * This is the test suite for equals(), toString(), and hashCode() for the
 * classes in the MusicPart interface (other methods are in the no_didit tests).
 * 
 * Testing strategy: test each method and make sure it is true to its spec for
 * every valid type of input. equals() must return true on equal objects, and
 * false on unequal objects. toString() must provide the appropriate string
 * representation of the object. hashCode() must return a hashcode that is the
 * same for equal objects.
 * 
 * Partition on complexity and modifiers, make sure things that Measures can
 * have 1 or any number of MusicSymbols, Voices can have 1 or any number of
 * measures, and MusicPieces can have 1 and any number of Voices. Also, make
 * sure duration shows up correctly (ie. 1/1 should be nothing, 1/2 should be
 * /2). Test the different modifiers of notes (' , ,, ^ ^^ _ __)
